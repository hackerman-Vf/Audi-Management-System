This project is a seat booking system for two auditoriums, each with 10 seats.
It allows users to view the auditorium layout, select a date and time, book seats, and view booking details.
The system ensures concurrency control using threading locks to prevent conflicts when multiple users attempt to book seats simultaneously. 
The project also stores booking details, including the user's name, phone number, email, and the date and time of booking. 
This system is designed to provide a seamless and efficient way to manage seat reservations in a multi-user environment.
